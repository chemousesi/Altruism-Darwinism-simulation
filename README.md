# Altruism-Darwinism-simulation
A simulation software of altruism and darwinism written in python with pygame library


- To run the simulation, you need to run the file : `altruisme.py`.
- You can edit the parameters in paramaters.json
- If the number of food spots in `parameters.json` is 0, we have a blank universe and put food with the mouse and then click `enter` key on the keyboard
- To display the graphic of the whole simulation at any moment you click the `g` key on the keyboard




the parameters of the simulation can be changed in the file parameters.json

it is possible to see the evolution of the different populations by pressing the key "g" during the simulation
